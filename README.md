# Notices

- Due to the internet being annoying, you can't just download the file with all the stuff neat and hidden, so you will have to manually hide some files.
- Recording in E8 is possible, but you will have to view the file online using the ```viewrecordings``` tool in ```\Media```, and following the second shortcut editing step, except using a video file (```.webm```) instead.

Select the files, then go to ```Properties``` > ```Tick the Hidden button at the bottom```
- Versions\Eaglercraft5.html
- Versions\Eaglercraft8.html
- Versions\EaglerCraft-Hacked-Client
- Versions\mc.ico
- Versions\eagler.ico

The only files you need unhidden are the shortcuts ```(.ink)```.

# Shortcuts

The shortcuts only work in ```N:\Downloads\eaglercraft-repo-main\eaglercraft-repo-main```, so if you want to use them elsewhere or rename stuff, follow these steps:

- Go to ```Properties``` > ```Change Icon``` > Find the icon and select it.
- Go into the target section and change the second path to your new directory. Don't edit the Chrome launch unless you want a different browser.

If you want custom icons and have an image ready, it will need to be a .ico file. Go to [icoconverter.com](https://www.icoconverter.com/) and drop your files in. Follow the above steps to set the icon.
