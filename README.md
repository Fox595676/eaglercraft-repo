# Notice

Due to the internet being annoying, you can't just download the file with all the stuff neat and hidden, so you will have to manually hide some files.

# Files to hide:

- Versions/Eaglercraft5.html
- Versions/Eaglercraft8.html
- Versions/EaglerCraft-Hacked-Client
- Versions/mc.ico
- Versions/eagler.ico

The only files you need unhidden are the shortcuts```(.ink)```.

# Shortcuts

The icons for the shortcuts for starting the game only work in N:\Downloads\eaglercraft-repo-main\eaglercraft-repo-main\Versions, so if you want to use them elsewhere, hide the icon then go to ```Properties``` > ```Change Icon``` > Find the icon and select it.
