# Notice

Due to the internet being annoying, you can't just download the file with all the stuff neat and hidden, so you will have to manually hide some files.

# Files to hide:

- Versions/Eaglercraft5.html
- Versions/Eaglercraft8.html
- Versions/EaglerCraft-Hacked-Client
- Versions/mc.ico
- Versions/eagler.ico

The only files you need unhidden are the shortcuts```(.ink)```.

# Shortcuts

The shortcuts for starting the game only work in ```N:\Downloads\eaglercraft-repo-main\eaglercraft-repo-main\Versions```, so if you want to use them elsewhere or rename stuff, follow these steps:
- Go to ```Properties``` > ```Change Icon``` > Find the icon and select it.
- Go into the target section and change the second path to your new directory. Don't edit the Chrome launch unless you want a different browser.

# Custom Icons

If you want custom icons and have an image ready, it will need to be a .ico file. Go to [icoconverter.com](https://www.icoconverter.com/) and drop your files in. Follow the above steps to set the icon.

# Backups

If you want to backup any worlds, go to ```Singleplayer``` > ```Click on your world``` > ```Backup``` > ```Export EPK file``` then put the file in ```\Worlds\ E8 or E5 depending on your version of choice```
