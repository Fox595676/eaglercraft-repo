# By the way

Due to the internet being annoying, you can't just download the file with all the stuff neat and hidden, so you will have to manually hide some files.

# Files to hide:

- Versions/Eaglercraft5.html
- Versions/Eaglercraft8.html
- Versions/EaglerCraft-Hacked-Client
- Versions/mc.ico
- Versions/eagler.ico

The only files you need unhidden are the shortcuts```(.ink)```.
